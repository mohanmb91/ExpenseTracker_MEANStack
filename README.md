## Technical Description of Project:

- Authentication is done with the help of Passport
- securing passwords using Salt && crypto npm package.
- Persisted login between page refresh.
- Client side Authorization is done based on roles. By doing so it helps us to restrict access to secured resources like _**/admin/users**_, which should be accessed only by admin.
- created resources and implemented authorization on server side
- CRUD operations is also implemented and the code is well refactored.
